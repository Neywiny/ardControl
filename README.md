# ardControl
controlling an arduino from an android phone, with the arduino communicating over serial to a computer with a socket server running


ardControl.ino is the arduino sketch, all other files are for the android application

## server.py dealt with the communication between phone and microcontroller and was lost from the harddrive so it is not present
